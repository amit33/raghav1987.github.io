		<p> This is paragraph 1. The Heartbeat Extension for the <b>Transport Layer Security (TLS)</b> and Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) protocols is a proposed standard specified by RFC 6520, published in February 2012. It provides a way to test and keep alive secure communication links without the need to renegotiate the connection each time.</p>
		<p> In 2011, <em>Dr. Robin Seggelmann</em>, then a Ph.D. student at the University of Duisburg-Essen, implemented the Heartbeat Extension for OpenSSL. Following Seggelmann's request to put the result of his work into OpenSSL,[17][18][19] his change was reviewed by Dr. Stephen N. Henson, one of OpenSSL's four core developers. Henson apparently failed to notice a bug in Seggelmann's implementation, and introduced the resulting vulnerability, Heartbleed, into OpenSSL's source code repository on December 31, 2011. Heartbeat support was enabled by default, causing affected versions to be affected by default. The vulnerable code has been adopted to widespread use with the release of OpenSSL version 1.0.1 on March 14, 2012</p>
		<p> Lets try some links here -> for instance, a <a href = "http://www.gmail.com" title = "Access Gmail">link</a> that opens in the same window, a <a href = "index.html" target = "_blank">new window</a>, and link to an <a href = "mailto:raghav1987@gmail.com">e-mail address</a>. Might as well add some images in here. Lets start with an image thats stored in the images folder kinda like <img src ="images/japan.gif" alt = "Japanese Flag">. Maybe also add an image that's a link like this one <img src ="http://girldevelopit.com/assets/pink-logo.png" alt = "Girl Develop It Logo"/>
